# Movie_Recommender_System

I have hosted the application. This is the link to the application http://54.196.181.248:8503/ 

I did data preprocessing in jupyter notebook. I also made my recommend function there. Initially I started with two database,
one is tmdb_5000_credits.csv and other is tmdb_5000_credits.csv. These both databases were processed in the jupyter notebook. Code to it and the recommmendation algorithm are written in Jupyter_code.ipynb

For making app I used pycharm and the code to app is in app.py. I imported database as pickle file. I made this pickle file in Jupyter notebook. I had two pickle files,
one is similarity.pkl and other is movie_dict.pkl. The similarity.pkl file is too large to upload here so I am providing link to it. Please consider accesing it 
through this link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dxCg1CBr5RCSh6RVwXCBg8LHjcB4wb9S/view?usp=sharing

For running Jupyter notebook code, three files will be needed: \
    1. Jupyter_code.ipynb \
    2. tmdb_5000_movies.csv \
    3. tmdb_5000_credits.csv 
    
For running pycharm code(Code to application) three files will be needed \
    1. app.py \
    2. similarity.pkl (please access it through the link) \
    3. movie_dict.pkl \
Please note that the application is made in virtual environment
